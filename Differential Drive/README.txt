1. Sweep motor code refers to the code for simply moving the motors for the differential drive

2. Implement drive for time refers to the code where the robots travels for a certain time and then stops and then again starts

3. Liner error test - This means that the robot is made to travel straight and then again made to come back
		in the same path. The robot does not come back in the same line. There is a slight error 
		or rather deviation in the path. that is being calculated here.

4. Square error test - In this test the drive is made to move in a square and then checked how much it deviated 
		from its initial position

5. Raw IR Reading -  Coding to use the IR sensor and to get values

6. Obstacle Avoidance -  a threshold is maintained. if the IR reading goes beyond that threshold then it turns
